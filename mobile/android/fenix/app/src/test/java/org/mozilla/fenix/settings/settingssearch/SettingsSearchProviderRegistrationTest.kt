/**
 * Drift-detection tests enforcing that every settings screen ends up in the search index, either through the
 * XML-parsing path in [DefaultFenixSettingsIndexer] or through a [SettingsSearchProvider] registered in
 * [settingsSearchProviders]. The only permitted exceptions are the screens listed in [intentionallyNotIndexed] and
 * [knownIndexingGaps].
 *
 * The screen list is derived from [PreferenceFileInformation]'s sealed hierarchy rather than hardcoded, so adding a new
 * screen and forgetting to register it anywhere fails these tests instead of silently making that screen unsearchable.
 * Both exception lists are themselves asserted against the index, so an entry that stops applying fails a test rather
 * than lingering.
